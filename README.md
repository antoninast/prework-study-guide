# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

This project was created to gain hands-on experience with key web technologies and understand how HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript work together to build functional websites. The goal was to explore their roles in creating structure, style, and interactivity while learning to organize code effectively for better usability and scalability.

Through this process, I developed a deeper understanding of these tools and how to combine them to create cohesive, user-friendly web pages. This project also addresses the need for a clear, simple place for beginners to learn the basics of the above mentioned technologies in one place. To add a touch of fun, the website is able to suggest a random topic from which the user should start learning.
